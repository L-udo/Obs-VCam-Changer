# Features:
```
- Support for changing virtual camera plugin for OBS's name
- Support for changing inbuilt virtual camera on OBS's name
- Gui interface
- Windows ONLY

```


# - How to get started

- Download the latest compiled version of Obs-VCam [Here](https://github.com/LudoDash/Obs-VCam-Changer/releases)

- Unzip and launch the application.

- Select a camera to change the name of.

- Pick a camera name from the list below or type your own:

- Away you go!





#Output:

```
~ New Name:<name> 
```
> (This is new name the camera was successfully set to!)


```
~ ERR-- Key doesn't exist
```
> (Means the program tried to set the key, but was unable to)


```
~ Kite says 'Wot camera?'
```
> (Means the program wasn't able to locate the camera in the registry key)

> It will commonly say this if you dont have the virtual camera plugin
> that adds more cameras (You DO NOT need to have the obs plugin installed for OBS VCam to work)

####Quick questions to ask yourself if you run into issues####:

- Do you have the latest version of OBS installed?
- Do you have the Virtual camera plugin installed?
- Did the application run as administrator
